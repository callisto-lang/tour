# The Callisto tour
Welcome to the Callisto tour! This tour aims to help a beginner who may not have experience
using stack based programming languages comfortable with Callisto.

If you haven't used stack based programming languages before, then start from the beginning
of the tour. If you have, then skip past the first section, as the stack works exactly
like Forth's.
